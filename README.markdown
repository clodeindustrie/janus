Older version of the original Janus with some tweaks to suit my vimrc.

* Added and changed keyboard mappings
* Have different settings depending on the platform (OSX, linux)
* Pimp up the style
* Have a php syntax tester
* A few deployement scripts
* Added a few plugins in the Rakefile

Not in use anymore as I switched to Emacs
